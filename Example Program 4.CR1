' The Explanation

' The goal of this program is to calculate basic moving averages starting with
' known input data. We'll also extract the minimum and maximum values of this
' known input data.


' The Constants

Const Moving_Average_Window = 3


' The Public Variables

Public Input_Vector(10) = {1, 3, 3, 2, 12, 22, 3, 13, 23, 4}
Public Output_Vector(10 - Moving_Average_Window + 1)
Public Minimum_Value(1, 2)
Public Maximum_Value(1, 2)
' Why are there 10 - Moving_Average_Window + 1 output values in this case?


' The Private Variables

Dim i


' The Data Tables

DataTable (Data_Table_4, 1, -1)
  DataInterval (0, 15, Sec, 10)
  Sample (10, Input_Vector(), FP2)
  Sample (10 - Moving_Average_Window + 1, Output_Vector(), FP2)
  Sample (1, Minimum_Value(), FP2)
  Sample (1, Maximum_Value(), FP2)
EndTable


' The Main Program

BeginProg
  Scan (1, Sec, 0, 0)
    For i = 1 To (10 - Moving_Average_Window + 1)
      AvgSpa (Output_Vector(i), Moving_Average_Window, Input_Vector(i))
    Next i
    ' Be cautious - if you need to calculate moving averages of columns in a
    ' matrix, you must first convert the matrix to a vector because the
    ' 'AvgSpa' command can only take vectors as inputs. We won't do an example
    ' of this operation together but I'll show you an example in a different
    ' script later.
    MinSpa (Minimum_Value(), 10, Input_Vector())
    MaxSpa (Maximum_Value(), 10, Input_Vector())
    ' I'm not sure why the 'MinSpa' and 'MaxSpa' commands return two things and
    ' not just 1 - it might be a bug in the program - but the syntax I provide
    ' here is what you should follow.
    CallTable Data_Table_4
  NextScan
EndProg
